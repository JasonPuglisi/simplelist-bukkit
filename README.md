# SimpleList

Simple player list plugin for Bukkit Minecraft servers with nickname and color
support.

## Usage

This plugin is no longer in development, and may not work with modern Minecraft
servers. There are no planned updates, so use at your own risk. It is still
completely stable for older versions of the Bukkit server.

## Overview

Aims to replace the default player list along with others. There are no
settings or permissions to configure.

Supports nicknames and colored text, which is commonly used in name prefixes.
Automatically hides vanished players, and can be used in-game or in-console.
